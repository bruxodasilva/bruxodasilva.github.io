## Radar Trap
Radar Trap helps you avoid being caught in speed camera traps.

It informs the driver about his current speed, the maximum speed considered by the radar and the distance to the police speed radar with visual and audio information.

It allows the driver to add to the database new radars and speed traps that he/she might find in the road.

The program allows you to import radars from different sources, such as: KML files (NDrive/Meo Drive), CSV files (Garmin), TXT files (iGO) and ASC files (Navigon).
